My FYP on using Deep Learning to identify brain based medical conditions in children

**Disclaimer:** This repo is intended for public viewing only. As the data used in this project is private, you cannot run the notebook independently. Contact me if you need more info.

## Problem Statement

1. It is difficult to analyze large number of ERSP plots to make predictions out of it
2. If deep learning can be used to identify the children's brain disorders from the normal ones
3. Can high accuracy with minimal false predictions be achieved with deep learning

## Project Objectives

1. To design a deep learning framework to identify dyslexic from normal controls using EEG data
2. To implement the framework and test it on a data set
3. To evaluate the accuracy of the deep learning framework

## Project Scope

### Dataset

1. Event Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP) images
2. 3228 total ERSP plots
3. 2662 training sets
4. 333 validation sets
5. 333 test sets

### Algorithm

1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
2. Implemented using KERAS module, on top of Tensorflow

## Extraction of feature from EEG Dataset
